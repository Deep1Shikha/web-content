# Install Milvus Cluster

## Before You Begin

Before moving forward to installation, you must check the eligibility of your hardware in line with Milvus' requirement.

<details><summary>Check your Docker and Docker Compose version</summary>

<div class="alert note">
Docker Compose is the recommended way to install Milvus.
</div>
- Docker version 19.03 or higher is required.
- Docker Compose version 1.25.1 or higher is required. 
</details>

<details><summary>Check whether your CPU supports SIMD extension instruction set</summary>

Milvus' computing operations depend on CPU’s support for SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) extension instruction set. Whether your CPU supports SIMD extension instruction set is crucial to index building and vector similarity search within Milvus. Ensure that your CPU supports at least one of the following SIMD instruction sets:

- SSE4.2
- AVX
- AVX2
- AVX512

Run the lscpu command to check if your CPU supports the SIMD instruction sets mentioned above:

```
$ lscpu | grep -e sse4_2 -e avx -e avx2 -e avx512
```
</details>

<details><summary>Check your GPU’s eligibility</summary>
Milvus Cluster supports GPU acceleration on floating vectors. 
- Supported Nvidia GPU versions are 6.0, 6.1, 7.0, and 7.5.

<div class="alert note">
You can access <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus">Nvidia</a>'s official website to check the corresponding version of your GPU. 
</div>

- Milvus requires [CUDA version 10.0 or higher](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive). 

<div class="alert note">
Enabling GPU acceleration in Milvus is optional. You can still run the whole Milvus service even if your server does not have a GPU device.
</div>

In the current version, the following vector indexes support GPU acceleration:

- FLAT
- IVF-FLAT
- IVF-SQ8
- IVF-PQ
